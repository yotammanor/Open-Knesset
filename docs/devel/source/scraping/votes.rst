Votes
=====

Votes are scraped using the syncdata process, specifically the "update_votes" function.

This functions interates based on vote id corresponding to knesset's vote page, e.g. http://www.knesset.gov.il/vote/heb/Vote_Res_Map.asp?vote_id_t=23556

For the above URL, the vote id is 23556.

We then scrape all the relevant data from that html page, and connect to related objects.
